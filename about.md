### I am a web enthusiast!!


Currently I am a Computer Science student in Greece, In my free time I research the web,
code or go for walks with my dog Chevy.

I also like to write and read, as well as training BJJ.

I like tinkering with stuff, and I love customization, my favorite language to code with is Ruby,
I am using it to do Rake scripts and web-developement.
