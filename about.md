### I am a web enthusiast!!


Right now I am studying Computer Science in Greece, In my free time I research the web,
code or go for long walks with my dog Chevy.

I also enjoy reading and writing, as well as training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

I like tinkering with stuff, and I love customization, my favorite languages to code with are Ruby and Python,
I am using Ruby with Rails and sometimes write Rake scripts.

Python is great for general purpose coding.
