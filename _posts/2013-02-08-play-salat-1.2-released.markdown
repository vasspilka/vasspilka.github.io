I've just published [play-salat](https://github.com/leon/play-salat) version 1.2

Version 1.2 comes with:

- Built against Play 2.1.0 to get [all the magic the new stuff](http://playframework.com).
- Sample updated to Play 2.1.0 and added JSON Rest example
- Salat 1.9.2-SNAPSHOT to get scala 2.10, I will release version 1.3 as soon as it's available in release.
- Mongo Options - Thanks to @ktonga we can now specify loads of settings for our mongo connections. [See settings](https://github.com/leon/play-salat/blob/master/src/test/scala/se/radley/plugin/salat/OptionsFromConfigSpec.scala#L19-L36) 
- Added JSON Reads and Writes for ObjectId. [See example](https://github.com/leon/play-salat/blob/master/sample/app/models/User.scala#L46)
