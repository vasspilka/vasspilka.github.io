Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, the only thing poor alice could see was

{% highlight ruby %}
 # Route to rabit-hole
 Class Mystery
   def initialize(hole , rabbit)
       @hole = hole
       @adventure = (hole + rabbit) if (time.now == late)
   end
 end
{% endhighlight %}



Why `@adventure = (hole + rabbit)` she thought to herself, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh dear! Oh
dear! I shall be too late!" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice
started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after
it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under
the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!

<p class="1st paragraph">The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that <span>Alice</span> had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed
to be a very deep well.</p>

<p class="2nd paragraph">Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to
make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;
then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were
filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and
pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed. It was labeled <span style="color:orange">"ORANGE MARMALADE,"</span> but, to her great
disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>
