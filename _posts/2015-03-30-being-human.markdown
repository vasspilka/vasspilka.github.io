There comes a time in everyones life where his desires interfere with his well being.

For us humans its common to have desires, it's common for them to rule our life and drive our behavior.    
But what happens when they interfere with our well being, what if those desires while being dissatisfied make us unproductive or
generally take away our joy in life.

In Buddhism they say one should minimize his desires, shift his attention to something else every time a they pass through his mind.
That way he can find himself in a state of observation, disconnect from his sense of self and his desires.    
That, they say is a way to lasting happiness and satisfaction.

I believe having desires and dissatisfaction is a part of being human, part of being alive.
Desires have driven us where we are now, it has driven science, art, build cities and most importantly kept the human kind alive.
Desires are a basic need for human existence.

But are they all that good? Should we always strive to have desires and be dissatisfied. I do not think that is the right way either.
I think one should control his desires, and have them push him towards the goals he has set in life.

First we need to understand that satisfaction is not something ever lasting. Often when you satisfy a desire there is a cycle
it passes through to come back. Once back you find yourself back in the state of dissatisfaction unless you ignore it, or distract yourself
with something else.

Desires get fortified when we are reminded of them, steam off when satisfied, and diminish when we ignore them. 

Satisfying a desire gives us this nice feeling of accomplishment we feel whole, we want to live to enjoy this! Enjoy life
and all its pleasures. Dissatisfaction gives us exactly the opposite.

But what if you have a desire that doesn't get satisfied, and you get reminded of it frequently, often by yourself.    
Is a desire like that healthy to nourish? Or should one try to avoid it?     
Logically one would only want to keep a desire in hopes it would be satisfied sometime in the future.
Why else would someone torment himself with dissatisfaction?

Maybe it is the weakness we all have to resist feelings.    
Maybe one is in denial believing his desire is going to be satisfied somehow.    
Maybe life is not all about feeling satisfied and whole.    

Be mindful with your desires, they shape your life, they are a tool you can use and push yourself forward, but they can also become a burden that will drag 
you down.
One thing I take for certain, if you have a desire you should act on it. Or it will keep you dissatisfied.
