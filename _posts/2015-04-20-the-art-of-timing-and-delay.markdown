I have learned a lesson recently, timing is important, it is one of the most important things for success.  
Act too soon or too late and you will most likely fail.

Greeks have this word called "Kairos", in English one would translate it to time, but it has little to do with the time we measure
with a clock. Kairos is the right time. Its the time where (not when) an opportunity is open for the grabs.
Kairos does not care about minutes or hours or even seconds, he only cares about the circumstances, he has the variables in their place.  
Kairos wants you to take the chance, and knows you will succeed.

Greeks describe opportunities as a woman that comes down from the sky, to catch lady opportunity one must grab her hair and pull her down, but she only has them
on the front side of her head, so you can only grab them when she is coming, once she turns around, she is gone.
I see that view as being over-simplified, with it you can see opportunities coming and all you have to do is catch them.
It is lacking one important detail... Know-how
I think there are tree prerequisites for an opportunity to be caught.  
The right circumstances, the know-how, and the action.

Thats why I imagine opportunities a little bit more complex.

I like to think of opportunities as existing in another realm, that realm is a gargantuan dark maze with endless halls and gates.
Wise old Kairos, lives in that maze. It is his home. He has knowledge of every passage, every corner and can open any gate without exception. He is King there.
He passes his time by wandering through the maze and whistling very silently, eternally passing from gate to gate and closing them behind him.
He is not alone however, we are all there with him, also wandering, unlike him though, we are lost.
In this dark place we are blind. Our only light, the experience we gained from exploring the maze, and the errors we made by bumping on closed gates.
If you haven't figured out already, the gates are our opportunities. So as Kairos takes his walks in his maze whistling
his song, if you happen to be close, and hear him, you can whistle with him, and follow him through a gate. That is how you get on the other side.
You have to hear his song, understand it, and whistle it with him as you pass though the gates.
He whistles silently though, sometimes you think you hear him but do not, sometimes he sings but you can't hear him.
There are times you need to take the chance, try to pass through the gate with the song you are hearing, be it Kairos or an illusion.

In my life I have made the mistake not to take some chances, many times I just waited next to the gate,
too afraid to walk through, too afraid I would bump into it or of what I would find on the other side.
But that denied me of valuable experience, I could have otherwise used the next time I saw an opportunity.
Having taken these chances I would be able to recognize the whistling of Kairos more accurately.

Nevertheless delaying has its merits. Knowing how to be patient and being able to wait for a better outcome, is as important as having the courage to take a chance.
Being able to delay an action for gratification, lets you have better control over yourself, and eventually over your life.  
By being patient, one can observe when the time is best to walk through that gate, and find himself on the other side.
Or even realize he didn't want to go through in the first place.  
By delaying you can gather more information and further analyze the problem, prepare yourself for the moment of action, plan for your success.
Time can give you insight to the problem and often some experience. It will give you better understanding of how to solve it, and can it can move the circumstances from being bad or "ok" to being perfect.

Circumstances will not stay perfect though, after a while they will get worse and worse. Up to a point that action will bring almost certain failure.
You see once Kairos closes the gate behind him it is insanely hard to squeeze through, most times impossible. And you never know when he decides to
walk by again.

To give you a taste of how delay can bring better outcomes I will set this article as an example.
I written a big chunk of it within a day, and I was eager to share it with the world, since I was writing about delay though
I decided to wait. The next day ideas started puring in, my content doubled within 3 days. And the quality tripled.
After I waited for a week since the original writing, I decided there are not a whole lot more to add, so I published.
Here is the article as it used to be if you are interested. [Timing and Delay](https://github.com/vasspilka/vasspilka.github.io/blob/f9ac0019d9bdf4a7db2bfbbbf17ee29b10525c4f/_posts/2015-04-20-the-art-of-timing-and-delay.markdown)

So how do we know that time is right? When should we choose to act, and when should we delay our actions?
Well the answer to that is not simple.  
They say novices should delay action for as long as they can, explore their options, themselves and their environment before taking the decision to act.
Experts will just know, they will know because of their experience.
Experience is pretty important in determining when to act, but it has to be coupled with observation, you have to see the signs and know what they mean.
Then should act accordingly.

It is truly an art to know when the time is right, and as with any art, you need to practice. To master it you need experience.
To gain experience however one needs to take chances. Live the life he is given. And learn from his mistakes.

Yes, delay, will give you a better understanding and some experience but nothings gives experience as the pure act of doing.
But be ware you have to analyze the risks, is the experience gained worth more to you than the potential loss of failure?

Experience is worth a lot to me!  
So I will take chances in order to get a better understanding
of Kairos, of when the time is right.   
I will make mistakes.  
I will fail, sometimes badly and I will suffer for it.  
But the experience gained will be invaluable.
