I have learned a lesson recently, timing is important, it is one of the most important things for success.  
Act too soon or too late and you will most likely fail. 

Greeks have this word called "Kairos", in English one would translate it to time, but it has little to do with the time we measure 
from a clock. Kairos is the right time. Its the time in which an opportunity is open for the grabs.
Kairos does not care about minutes or hours or even seconds, he only cares about the circumstances, he has everything where it should be.  
Kairos wants you to take the chance, and knows you will succeed. 

One can view opportunities as a clear glass doors, that will open only for a short period of time, but we can't see if they are open or not 
since they are transparent. Only with good observation and passed experience one will notice an opening. You can try to pass the door at any time. 
If it is closed though... You will fail.   
Sometimes you'll get another chance, or manage to squeeze your way through. Most of the times, you won't.

That is why knowing when the time is right is so important. And we can achieve that by observation and experience. 

In my life I have made the mistake not to take chances, I waited many times never passing through the door, sometimes I even saw it close in front of me.
I was afraid to walk through, afraid I would bump into the glass or of what I would find on the other side.
But that denied me of valuable experience, I could have otherwise used the next time I saw an opportunity.

Nevertheless delaying has its merits. Knowing how to be patient and being able to wait for a better outcome, is as important as having the courage to take a chance.
Being able to delay an action for gratification, lets you have better control over yourself, and eventually over your life.  
By being patient, one can observe when the time is best to walk through, and find himself on the other side of the door.
Or even realize whether he truly wanted to go through it in the first place.

So how do we know that time is right? When should we choose to act, and when should we delay our actions? Well the answer to that is not simple.  
They say novices should delay action for as long as they can, explore their options, themselves and their environment before taking the decision to act.
Experts will just know, they will know because of their experience.
Experience is pretty important, but it has to be coupled with observation, you have to see the signs and know what they mean.
Then should act accordingly.

To gain experience however one needs to take some chances. Live the life he is given. And learn from his mistakes.

There is another thing I have not mentioned yet. Preparation. What would delay be if in the meantime you could not plan for your success.
By delaying action you can gain more time to plan and prepare your actions. Often for a better outcome. 
Constantly delaying though can be dangerous, you can miss your chance, miss Kairos. Then your plans and actions will no longer matter.  
It is truly an art to know when the time is right.

I have made a promise to myself.  
I will get a better understanding of Kairos, of when the time is right.  
To do that I will have to take chances, get the experience I need.  
I will make mistakes.  
I will fail, sometimes badly and I will suffer for it.  
But the experience gained will be invaluable.
