The notion of a belief being a mind construct is rather interesting to me. 
Indeed purely just the fact that human being have the ability to believe is something to wonder about by itself.

So what is a believe? Well by definition  w



We somehow are able to convince ourselves of a truth while not knowing. 



But can we learn to better structure our beliefs in order to use this construct to enhance our lives?

 how and by whom is it build,

They are build by your mind as it observes and experiences the world.


## What is it 

## A belief can be constructed

## Belief independace/cooexistence 
belief complexes
making space for uncertainty

## Belief constructions can be used as foundations of other beliefs
also they can be pathways to other belief complexes

## Dangers of building on top of bad/faulty belief
blocking space for constructing other beliefs
